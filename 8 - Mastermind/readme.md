The idea of this Kata is to code an algorithm capable of playing this boring role: answering the number of well placed and misplaced colors.

Therefore, your function should return, for a secret and a guessing combination:

the number of well placed colors
the number of correct but misplaced colors
A combination can contain any number of pegs but youâ€™d better give the same number for the secret and the guessing. You can use any number of colors.
